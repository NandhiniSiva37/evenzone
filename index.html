            suppliers, venues and more.<br>
            One of the main reasons behind the success of Event Planner is the fact that the team does not

            to add exorbitant fees and mark-ups to make its profit margins.</p>

           <li> Motivation:</li>
                There must be a reason for why you are doing your event, so find the reason and understand what your crowd will be looking for, especially what kind of event you want to deliver and why you are currently developing your event.

            <li>Idea:</li>
                Now that you know what you are trying to do, you need to shine above the rest. How do you do this? Bouncy castle at a wedding? Upside down cakes hanging? Mermaids? Party in the middle of St Elmo’s? Maybe a masseur in the middle of your venue, to the sound of a live saxophonist. We’ve done this all (and more!) before, and we’ve got you covered for everything.

            <li>Knowing your Crowd:</li>
                Understand the kind of people you are trying to attract or that you are trying to impress. What is the age of those attending? What do they like? Right now it’s key that reflect upon these questions so as to know who you are catering for.

            <li>The Venue:</li>
                This is the first real step in making your event legendary, classic, and original; the event that everyone is going to want to organise. It starts from the location, it’s all about the location. We can get you almost any place if you think ahead of time, most places have permits which can be obtained if you know the right people. (That’s us for those who are wondering) Sorting the event location, will then lead you to setting the…

            <li>Ambience:</li>
                Once a venue is settled, the ambience and venue’s atmosphere should be taken highly into consideration. Whether this is in fairy lights, tiki torches, spotlights or flood lights, lighting in combination with décor are fillers of negative space as well as focal points around a venue, and work towards setting the mood for what you want to achieve at your event. Rest assured, that this is what makes an event Instagram-worthy for your guests!

            <li>Catering:</li>
                Whether you are getting a Michelin star chef, or organising a good old “Majjalata”, you must make sure that you have enough food and drink to keep everyone happy from the start to finish. From the smallest dishes to the most complicated cocktails, think ahead of time, find the right caterer and the best deal.

            <li>Entertainment:</li>
                There is nothing else quite like it. From music, to live dancers, to maybe even mermaids; we’ve got it all. Innovation is of recently kicking in with live event entertainment such as Nitrogen Ice-Cream, masseurs at events, fire dancers, or roller hostesses.

           <li>music:</li>
                Music is a drug transferred by physical, or emotional waves, or so they say. What it really does, is sets the scene; the first notes as your guests are coming through the door, till the final beats at the end of the night. Having a good rhythm will set the stage for everything to come together.

            <li>Videographer:</li>
                What is the good in planning an event so memorable, if you have nothing tangible to remember it with? Carry your good vibes with you, and make them last longer in physical and digital memories that you can forever cherish.
